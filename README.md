# Bookmark Manager

This is a simple web page that displays some of my bookmarks. It uses HTML and CSS to create a basic layout and style.

## Features

- The web page has two sections: Primary Bookmarks and Secondary Bookmarks. Each section contains five links to some of the most popular and useful websites on the internet.
- The links are styled with different colors and fonts to make them attractive and easy to read.
- The links open the bookmarked websites in a new tab, so that the user can switch between them without losing the web page.
- The web page has a light cyan background color that gives it a soothing and refreshing look.

## How to customize

- The user can customize the bookmarks by editing the `index.html` file and changing the `href` attribute of the anchor tags. The user can also change the text content of the anchor tags to give them different titles.
- The user can customize the style of the web page by editing the `style.css` file and changing the properties of the `body`, `h1`, `h2`, and `p` selectors. The user can change the background color, font size, font family, text alignment, and other properties as per their preference.

## How to run

- To run the web page, the user needs to have a web browser installed on their computer. The user can use any web browser of their choice, such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox.
- The user needs to download the `index.html` and `style.css` files from the GitHub repository and save them in the same folder on their computer.
- The user needs to open the `index.html` file with their web browser and enjoy the web page.
